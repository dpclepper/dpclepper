# Hi, I'm Danny! üëã

üè´ Hey! I'm Danny Clepper, a product-focused data science enthusiast with a strong background in analytics, statistics, and machine learning. Currently, I'm studying Data Science at Columbia University, having recently graduated with a BS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (go Badgers!).

üìä Throughout my education, I've had a wealth of internship experiences across multiple domains, most recently working on feature engineering for Visa's Predictive Modeling organization. My expertise lies in SQL, Python, Tableau, and machine learning modeling, enabling me to extract and deliver valuable insights from complex data.

## Portfolio

### Machine Learning

#### Venture Capital Startup Success Prediction - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Venture-Success)
I applied CART, random forest, logistic regression, and other techniques including dimensionality reduction and regularization to a dataset containing funding and market data for 40,000+ startups to predict startup "success." I analyzed differences in ROC-AUC scores and Type I/II error tradeoffs to select the best performing model. Finally, I wrote a report focusing on the project outcomes from a venture capital (VC) fund perspective to contextualize the results.

#### Analyzing Microbusiness Density for Informed Economic Policy - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Microbusiness)
I leveraged advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, including Neural Networks, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost, to analyze microbusiness density across U.S. counties using data from GoDaddy and the U.S. Census. This comprehensive analysis involved hyperparameter tuning, correlation assessments, and feature importance evaluation to refine prediction models and capture the nuances influencing microbusiness activities. The final report delineates the influence of geographic, educational, and internet access factors on microbusiness density, providing actionable insights for policymakers to enhance economic resilience and growth.

### Analytics Engineering

#### Easyplant Analytics Engineering Pipeline - [link](https://github.com/columbiateam14/dbt_plant_sales)
I devised and deployed an end-to-end data stack for a self-watering plant startup consisting of ingesting data from multiple sources including Snowflake and Google Drive in Fivetran, transforming data from raw form to analytics-ready production data in dbt, and warehousing in Snowflake. Following this, I created dashboards in Preset (formerly Apache Superset) detailing customer lifecycle across website, revenue breakdowns, forecasts, and hiring analytics.


### Data/Statistical Analysis

#### Global Life Expectancy Exploration - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Life-Expectancy)
I investigated the life expectancy dataset from the World Health Organization (WHO) between 1995 and 2015 to see general trends and take a closer look at differences across factors including country development status, GDP, and year. I performed initial data analysis, Welch's two-sample hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and a multiple linear regression model in R.

#### Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuel Consumption Data Analysis - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Energy)
I investigated multiple datasets from The World Bank on renewable energy consumption, fossil fuel energy consumption, and renewable electricity output across numerous countries, focusing on the differences between these factors and how certain features including region and year influence these values and their corresponding differences. I cleaned the data using multiple techniques, conducted an exploratory data analysis and analysis of variance, and created a multiple linear regression model.

### Simulation Modeling and Analysis

#### Costco Gas Station Simulation Modeling - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Costco-Gas-Station)
I collected 10+ hours of queueing data at the Madison Costco gas station over multiple weeks to gain information from a system perspective. Using arrival time, pump start time, and departure time for 1,000's of vehicles at the gas station, I created a model in Arena Simulation Software to compare against the models. I developed alternatives to the model structure and performed alternative analysis to select the best model that optimizes time in system and system capacity.
