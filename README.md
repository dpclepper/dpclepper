# Hi, I'm Danny! 👋

🏫 I'm an rising senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering with a concentration in Engineering Analytics & Operations Research. Additionally, I am pursuing minors in Data Science and Leadership to complement my engineering education. This past summer, I interned at Kraft Heinz doing Business Intelligence Analyst work on the Enterprise Architecture team where I developed dashboards, performed statistical analyses, and communicated insights to company leaders.

📊 I have work experience and completed coursework concentrating in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Julia, and Arena. At UW-Madison, I have taken courses in theory and methods of mathematical statistics, operations research, probabilistic and deterministic modeling, simulation modeling, decision analysis, and economic analysis.
