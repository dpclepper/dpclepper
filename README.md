# Hi, I'm Danny! üëã

üè´ I'm a rising senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering with a concentration in Engineering Analytics & Operations Research. Additionally, I am pursuing minors in Data Science and Leadership to complement my engineering education. This past summer, I worked as a Digital & Technology Intern at Kraft Heinz on the Enterprise Architecture team where I developed dashboards, performed statistical analyses, and communicated insights to company leaders.

üìä I have work experience and completed coursework concentrating in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Julia, and Arena. At UW-Madison, I have taken courses in theory and methods of mathematical statistics, data science modeling, data structures and algorithms, machine learning, operations research, probabilistic and deterministic modeling, simulation modeling, decision analysis, and economic analysis.

**How to reach me!**

## Portfolio

### Data/Statistical Analysis

#### Global Life Expectancy Exploration - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Life-Expectancy)
I investigated the life expectancy dataset from the World Health Organization (WHO) between 1995 and 2015 to see general trends and take a closer look at differences across factors including country development status, GDP, and year. I performed initial data analysis, Welch's two-sample hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and a multiple linear regression model in R.

#### Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuel Consumption Data Analysis - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Energy)
I investigated multiple datasets from The World Bank on renewable energy consumption, fossil fuel energy consumption, and renewable electricity output across numerous countries, focusing on the differences between these factors and how certain features including region and year influence these values and their corresponding differences. I cleaned the data using multiple techniques, conducted an exploratory data analysis and analysis of variance, and created a multiple linear regression model.

### Machine Learning

#### Predicting Startup Success with Machine Learning - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Venture-Success)
I applied CART, random forest, logistic regression, and other techniques including dimensionality reduction and regularization to a dataset containing funding and market data for 40,000+ startups to predict startup "success." I analyzed differences in ROC-AUC scores and Type I/II error tradeoffs to select the best performing model. Finally, I wrote a report focusing on the project outcomes from a venture capital (VC) fund perspective to contextualize the results.

### Simulation Modeling and Analysis

#### Costco Gas Station Simulation Modeling - [link](https://github.com/dpclepper/Costco-Gas-Station)
I collected 10+ hours of queueing data at the Madison Costco gas station over multiple weeks to gain information from a system perspective. Using arrival time, pump start time, and departure time for 1,000's of vehicles at the gas station, I created a model in Arena Simulation Software to compare against the models. I developed alternatives to the model structure and performed alternative analysis to select the best model that optimizes time in system and system capacity.
